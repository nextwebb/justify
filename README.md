#what is justify all about

Justify is solution which tackles the fifth challenge which was provided by the UNODC....

##The challenge justify is solving

â€‹		MAKE THEM AWARE AND THEY WILL START TO CARE

##WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WE ARE SOLVING

1. It isn't noticed that most people get the rights violated because they do not know their rights.
2. People do not know how to get justice.

Now lets think about this for a second, 

- What if people know their rights, dont you think they wouldnt allow anyone to violate it? 
- what if people know that their right has been violated but they dont know how to get justice?
- or how i would someone even think of getting justice when he/she isnt even aware that his/her right have been violated?



##OUR TECHNICAL  SOLUTIONS

We are building a platform which addresses all the above problems. The question now is how???
